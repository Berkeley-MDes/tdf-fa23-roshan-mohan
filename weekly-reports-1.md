bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.
Images & Video
images & video should be unified with your presentation (not just a folder of images)

Sketches, Drawings, and Diagrams
this could include flowcharts, design files, whiteboarding, storyboards, etc
pencil & paper sketches, drawings, post-its, etc (photographed or scanned and uploaded)
