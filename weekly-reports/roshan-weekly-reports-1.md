# Reflections #

The first thing was to understand computational design 

This short video helped a lot 
[What is Computational Design? And 9 Concepts Related to It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCptKvK-9Hg&list=PLnUpabNzAM_6xD42LHlE_0oTdrk3vr9hb&index=2)

NURBs in parametric design was a concept new to me, I went on a little rabbit hole trying to understand NURBs
[Intro to NURBs](https://www.3ds.com/store/cad/nurbs-modeling)

Tried modelling a loft in Rhino and replicated the same model through Grasshopper

# Speculations #
in complete sentences or paragraphs, and perhaps images or videos.
speculation on future direction for the tools [so much is changing very quickly right now, where do you think this is going? Why do you think this?]
speculation on future direction for the work
bonus: thoughtful descriptions of something interesting and relevant you heard about in the news or industry publications. include text, an image, a link, and a reference that you can follow up on later and share with your peers.
Images & Video
images & video should be unified with your presentation (not just a folder of images)
images & video should be directly relevant to the project (What does each shot show us?)
Sketches, Drawings, and Diagrams
this could include flowcharts, design files, whiteboarding, storyboards, etc
pencil & paper sketches, drawings, post-its, etc (photographed or scanned and uploaded)
