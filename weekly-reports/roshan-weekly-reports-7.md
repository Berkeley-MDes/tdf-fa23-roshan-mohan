Got an intro to particle.io.

Held 2 meetings with my team to decide the direction all wanted to take and assigned tasks. I started working on the sensors and hardware.

Ordered TOF sensors from amazon and started the integration. Facing severe issues in VScode+connectivity for particle, which is eating away time from actually working on the project. 

Target is a small scale chime that is sized like a normal wind chime but without the chimes. Whenever the striker hits a sensor area, the sound will be produced from the speaker on top of the chime.
